---Form name: Supplemental Immunization Activity
---Objective: This form is used to collect the vaccination campaign actual values. Some of the questions include: no. of children who have been vaccinated per age group and gender, no. of children who have refused/deferred and reason breakdown for refusal and deferral
---Inform link: https://inform.unicef.org/uniceftemplates/635/759
--- The connector normally creates a separate table for the repeat groups and labels that can be joined to the other tables using SQL
-- To be able to execute the queries below, you'll need access to the following tables 
                  -- a. supplemental_immunization_activity - this is the table that has all the responses from the Supplemental Immunization Activity form on Inform
                  -- b. admin1 - this table contains all the admin1 level admin names and codes
                  -- c. admin2 - this table contains all the admin2 level admin names and codes
                  -- d. admin3 - this table contains all the admin3 level admin names and codes
                  -- e. admin4 - this table contains all the admin4 level admin names and codes
                  -- f. admin5 - this table contains all the admin5 level admin names and codes
                  -- g. supplemental_immunization_activity_vaccine - the repeat group table that has the vaccination data ie no.of children vaccinated/deferred/refused per age group and gender
                  -- h. supplemental_immunization_activity_target - has the number of vaccines received, campaign start and end date, 
                  -- i. supplemental_immunization_activity_target_target_children - has the no. of children to be vaccinated per age group
--Note: The administrative hierarchy is dependent on the country that is implementing the RT-VaMA tool kit. On queries below, we used Philippines administrative hierarchy as our use case.
